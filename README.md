# Wizard101 Damage Calculator

This program is used to calculate damage in the MMO Wizard101, including various buffs and any custom ones applied by the game itself.

# How It Works

The calculator starts by asking you what kind of damage your spell does: range or guarantee (for example, a range is something like 405-535, while guarantee/definite is something
like 335). Afterwards, it asks you to enter your gear damage (damage given by your gear) and the spell's base damage. Finally, you can press any buttons you'd like, adding and removing certain
modifiers and scaling with critical hits.

# State of The Program

I'll admit it, the code for it is a mess, and I've most likely gone about it in the worst way. I'm trying to learn tkinter more, so I can fix the problems with the program in the future
(the amount of global statements is just bizarre).

That being said, this program will go unchanged for now. There might be a day where I do a complete rewrite of the code to make it more appealing to look at, but that day is not anytime soon.
